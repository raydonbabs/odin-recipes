		<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>This ham and beans recipe was created by my mom, and I really enjoyed it as a child. 
                As an adult, my taste changed just a bit, so I modified her recipe to kick it up a bit. 
                It is fabulous even though the ingredients list is quite short! 
                This is a must-make with leftover ham and everyone agrees it's absolutely delicious.
            </p>

				<li>1 pound dry great Northern beans</li>
                    <li>½ pound cooked ham, diced</li>
                    <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
                    <li>½ cup brown sugar</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon dried parsley</li>
                    <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>

			</ul>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Rinse beans; transfer to a large stockpot. 
                    Cover with cold water and let stand overnight or at least 8 hours. 
                    Drain and rinse beans.
                </li>
                <li>Return beans to stockpot; add ham, onion, sugar, parsley, and cayenne pepper. 
                    Pour in enough water to cover and season with salt and pepper. 
                    Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer until beans are tender, adding more water if needed, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
